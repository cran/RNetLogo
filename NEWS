Changes in version 0.9-6:
	BUG FIXES
	*NLStart(<nl.path>, ...) failed with: Error in .jnew	 ("nlcon/Preprocess") : java.lang.UnsupportedClassVersionError: 	 nlcon/Preprocess : Unsupported major.minor version 51.0}. This 	 happend when using Java versions before 7. The .jar files are 	 now compiled with support up to Java 5. 
	*several bug fixes and changes in manual pages, code examples 	 and tutorial

	NEW FEATURES
	*Change.log moved to NEWS.Rd. Therefore, news() function is 	supported now.
	*Argument obj.name in NLStart is replaced by nl.obj. In all 	other	functions nl.obj is now also a string instead of an 		reference to NetLogo. References are handled internally, now, 	and no global variables are created anymore. 
	*More clear working directory handling strategy: stores the 	working directory active before creating the first NetLogo 	instance. Reset to this wd after closing the last active 	NetLogo instance.
	*New all argument in NLQuit to close/quit all open NetLogo 	instances.


Changes in version 0.9-5:
	BUG FIXES
	*Just a fix to fulfill CRAN policy: limit max. parallel 	 processes in vignette parallelProcessing.Rnw to 2 core.

	*Update of manual pages.
	*Spelling corrections in parallelProcessing guide.
	*Small corrections due to package building warnings.
      
	NEW FUNCTIONS
	*NLSetPatchSet added, especially usefull for NetLogo 3D as an 	 equivalent to NLSetPatches, which works only with NetLogo 2D.

	NEW FEATURES
	*New argument max.minutes added to NLDoCommandWhile and 	 NLDoReportWhile. It stops the execution after a defined number 	 of minutes (default: 10), if it is > 0.
	*parallelProcessing.pdf and performanceNotes.pdf moved to 	 vignettes.


Changes in version 0.9-3
	NEW FUNCTIONS
	*Experimental function NLSetAgentSet added (may change or be 	 deleted in future).

	NEW FEATURES
	*NetLogo 5.0 is default in NLStart (nl.version=5) --> NetLogo 	 5.0 is much more faster than NetLogo 4.1.x in sending values 	 to R!
	*Support of NetLogo 4.0.x added (use nl.version=40 in NLStart).
	*Rewrite of functions NLGetAgentSet, NLGetPatches, NLGetGraph 	 for markable speed improvements.
	*Default return type of NLGetAgentSet and NLGetPatches is a 	 data.frame instead of a list.
	*Document "performanceNotes.pdf" added.
	*Document "parallelProcessing.pdf" added.


Changes in version 0.9-2:
	BUG FIXES
	*Typo in manual fixed (order of arguments in NLDoCommand).

	NEW FEATURES
	*Support for NetLogo 3D added (extra boolean argument is3d in 	 NLStart).
	*Better clean up at NLQuit (but this is still a problem. 	 NetLogo offers no clean up for all threads, they just do a  	 System.exit, which can not be used with rJava, because it will 	 terminate the JVM, therefore also rJava and finally R as 	 well.)


Changes in version 0.9-1
	BUG FIXES
	*JARs compiled against Java 1.5 now instead of Java 1.6.
