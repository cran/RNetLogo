  abstract = {We perform analysis of data on crime and violence for 5,660 U.S. cities
	over the period of 2005-2009 and uncover the following trends: 1)
	The proportion of law enforcement officers required to maintain a
	steady low level of criminal activity increases with the size of
	the population of the city; 2) The number of criminal/violent events
	per 1,000 inhabitants of a city shows non-monotonic behavior with
	size of the population. We construct a dynamical model allowing for
	system-level, mechanistic understanding of these trends. In our model
	the level of rational behavior of individuals in the population is
	encoded into each citizen's perceived risk function. We find strong
	dependence on size of the population, which leads to partially irrational
	behavior on the part of citizens. The nature of violence changes
	from global outbursts of criminal/violent activity in small cities
	to spatio-temporally distributed, decentralized outbursts of activity
	in large cities, indicating that in order to maintain peace, bigger
	cities need larger ratio of law enforcement officers than smaller
	cities. We also observe existence of tipping points for communities
	of all sizes in the model: reducing the number of law enforcement
	officers below a critical level can rapidly increase the incidence
	of criminal/violent activity. Though surprising, these trends are
	in agreement with the data.},
