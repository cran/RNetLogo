	The book begins by introducing the R language, including the development

	features, you'll also get a crash course in practical statistics,
	including basic and advanced models for normal and non- normal data,
	longitudinal and survival data, and a wide variety of multivariate
	methods. Both data mining methodologies and approaches to messy and
	incomplete data are included.},
