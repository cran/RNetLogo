- Starting RNetLogo in GUI mode with R 2.15.2 on Windows 32-bit (workaround: use 2.15.1 or JGR or RStudio)
- Unloading Java/NetLogo not fully possible (maybe some memory is also not released) --> due to rJava and NetLogo (system.exit), no solution via RNetLogo possible
- Resetting working directory after NLQuit only works with the internal nl.obj (.nl.intern) not with user specified object names
