v0.9.3

- NetLogo 5.0 is default in NLStart (nl.version=5) --> NetLogo 5.0 is much more faster than NetLogo 4.1.x in sending values to R!
- Rewrite of functions NLGetAgentSet, NLGetPatches, NLGetGraph for markable speed improvements
- Default return type of NLGetAgentSet and NLGetPatches is a data.frame instead of a list
- experimental function NLSetAgentSet added (may change or be deleted in future)
- Support of NetLogo 4.0.x added (use nl.version=40 in NLStart)
- Document "PerformanceNotes" added
- Document "ParallelProcessing" added


v 0.9.2

- typo in manual fixed (order of arguments in NLDoCommand)
- support for NetLogo 3D added (extra boolean argument is3d in NLStart)
- test with NetLogo 5.0RC5 (successful)
- better clean up at NLQuit (but this is still a problem. NetLogo offers no clean up for all threads,
  they just do a System.exit, which can not be used with rJava, because it will terminate the JVM, therefore
  also rJava and finally R as well.)


v 0.9.1

- fixed bug: JARs compiled against Java 1.5 now instead of Java 1.6
