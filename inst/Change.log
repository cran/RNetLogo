v 0.9.2

- typo in manual fixed (order of arguments in NLDoCommand)
- support for NetLogo 3D added (extra boolean argument is3d in NLStart)
- test with NetLogo 5.0RC5 (successful)
- better clean up at NLQuit (but this is still a problem. NetLogo offers no clean up for all threads,
  they just do a System.exit, which can not be used with rJava, because it will terminate the JVM, therefore
  also rJava and finally R as well.)


v 0.9.1

- fixed bug: JARs compiled against Java 1.5 now instead of Java 1.6
